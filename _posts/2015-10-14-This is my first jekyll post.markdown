This is the first time i am wrting in the jekyll posts and it seems to be very easy to maintain my `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
print 'melvin is using jekyll'
#=> prints 'Hi, melvin' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
